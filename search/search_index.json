Larger and heavier (~200\u2013250g each estimated for 37D series) than 25D or micro motors, making the rover bulkier and harder to keep \"small/lightweight\". Helical first-stage gears reduce noise and improve efficiency/smoothness compared to pure spur designs. Higher stall current (~5.5A) demands a robust H-bridge/driver (e.g., not marginal with basic dual-channel ICs like DRV8833 at peaks). Larger 6mm D-shaft and robust 37mm-diameter build offer superior durability and easier wheel mounting for student projects. Lower no-load speed (~530 RPM) results in slower top speed with typical wheels (e.g., ~1.5\u20132 m/s), which may feel sluggish for flat exploration unless PWM-boosted."},{"location":"03-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#pololu-4843-2041-metal-gearmotor-25dx65l-mm-hp-12v-with-48-cpr-encoder","title":"Pololu 4843: 20.4:1 Metal Gearmotor 25Dx65L mm HP 12V with 48 CPR Encoder","text":"<p>link to product</p> Pros Cons Balanced performance: 7.4 kg\u00b7cm stall torque + 500 RPM no-load gives good mix of power for obstacles and decent speed for covering ground quickly. High stall current (~5A) requires careful driver selection and power supply design to handle peaks without voltage sag or overheating. Integrated high-resolution encoder (48 CPR motor \u2192 ~980 CPR output) simplifies odometry/PID control without extra components. Slightly longer body (65 mm) and 98g weight per motor add up in a compact rover chassis compared to micro options. Compact 25mm diameter cylindrical form factor fits well in small-to-mid rover designs; metal gears ensure longevity. Torque is solid but lower than larger 37D motors, so less headroom on very steep slopes or with added payload (e.g., sensors/arm). <p>### Pololu 5223: 250:1 Micro Metal Gearmotor HPCB 12V with 12 CPR Encoder, Side Connector</p> <p></p> <p>link to product</p> Pros Cons Extremely compact (10\u00d712 mm gearbox cross-section, lightweight ~20\u201330g) ideal for truly miniature/small rovers with tight space/weight constraints. Very high gear reduction leads to low no-load speed (~130 RPM), resulting in slow rover movement (e.g., &lt;0.5 m/s with small wheels) \u2014 may not suit faster exploration tasks. High stall torque relative to size (~3.0 kg\u00b7cm) sufficient for light rovers on flat/moderate terrain with good wheel leverage. Lower absolute torque limits capability on rougher terrain, steeper inclines, or if rover mass exceeds ~2\u20133 kg total. Integrated encoder (12 CPR) + HPCB (high-power carbon brush) motor provides reliable feedback and efficiency in a tiny package; side connector eases wiring in small chassis. Smaller 3mm D-shaft and micro construction may have more backlash or wear under heavy/continuous use compared to larger metal gearmotors."},{"location":"03-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#optimal-motor-selection-pololu-4843-2041-metal-gearmotor-25dx65l-mm-hp-12v-with-48-cpr-encoder","title":"Optimal Motor Selection: Pololu #4843 (20.4:1 Metal Gearmotor 25Dx65L mm HP 12V with 48 CPR Encoder)","text":"<p>The Pololu #4843 is the optimal choice for the small exploration rover's drive train after comparing it to the #4741 (18.75:1 37D series) and #5223 (250:1 micro HPCB series). It delivers a strong balance of 7.4 kg\u00b7cm stall torque and 500 RPM no-load speed at 12 V, enabling reliable performance on moderate terrain (e.g., 15\u00b0 inclines, light gravel) with practical speeds (~1.5\u20132.5 m/s using 80\u2013120 mm wheels) and ample margin for a ~2\u20135 kg rover\u2014outperforming the slower #5223 and avoiding the excessive bulk of the larger #4741. Its integrated 48 CPR encoder (yielding ~980 CPR at output) provides precise odometry and closed-loop control without added components, directly supporting project feedback needs. The compact 25 mm \u00d7 65 mm size and ~98 g weight per motor fit a small chassis perfectly, while full metal gears ensure durability and longevity under student testing conditions. Operating efficiently on common 3S LiPo batteries with manageable current draw, and backed by Pololu's excellent documentation and ecosystem, it minimizes risks and integration effort\u2014making it the best overall fit for capability, compactness, reliability, and project practicality compared to the alternatives.</p>"},{"location":"03-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#texas-instruments-drv8873-eg-drv8873spwpr-or-similar-variant-htssop-24-smd-package","title":"Texas Instruments DRV8873 (e.g., DRV8873SPWPR or similar variant; HTSSOP-24 SMD package)","text":"<p>link to product</p> Pros Cons High current capability (up to 10 A peak, integrated current sensing) handles the 5 A stall comfortably with headroom for spikes during direction changes or loads. Slightly higher cost compared to basic drivers; may require good PCB thermal design/heatsinking for sustained high-current operation. Wide voltage range (4.5\u201338 V) and excellent built-in protections (overcurrent, thermal shutdown, undervoltage lockout, fault reporting) reduce damage risk in student rover testing. Larger package footprint than ultra-compact options, though still SMD-friendly for custom PCBs. Integrated features like current-sense output simplify monitoring stall/overload in firmware; popular TI part with good datasheets and examples.

Wide 5\u201336 V range, integrated protections (overtemperature, short-circuit, UVLO, current limiting), and SPI diagnostics or simple error flag for easy debugging. Higher unit cost; less common in hobby/student examples compared to TI parts, though well-documented.

Full H-bridge (or configurable) with integrated protections (overcurrent, thermal, undervoltage) and PWM compatibility; suitable for brushed DC in rover differential drive. May be overkill (higher voltage range) for a strict 12 V setup, adding minor cost/complexity. Good availability on DigiKey, detailed TI datasheets, and features like fault monitoring for reliable student projects.
